Project description:
- Topic: steward/estuary management
- player will play the role of the estuary manager
- the setting of the game will be in St. Jones' River
- there will be characters on the map that will play the roles of estuary employees;
the player will be able to control an employee by clicking on their avatar and then 
clicking on different parts of the map to make each employee perform different tasks
- each employee will have a different inventory with different items that correspond to
different hazards; these items will be used to eliminate the hazards
- there will be enemy characters ("hazards") that will appear randomly on the map 
denoted by exclamation marks above their avatars; hazards take time to eliminate 
so there will be an element of strategy in the choice of what hazards the player should
eliminate first
- if the hazards are not eliminated on time, they will deplete the estuary's health and
possibly multiply
- there will also be NPCs on the map that will have other tasks (not mandatory) for the
player to complete to potentially increase the estuary's health; they will be denoted by
question marks above their avatars
- the game ends once 1-2 minutes have passed or the estuary's health has depleted to 0 HP
